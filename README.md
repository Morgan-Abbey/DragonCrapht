An axed project of mine. It does have a cheesy name.

I used Visual Studio 2022 to make this project using ASP.NET Framework in conjunction with Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio.

**Project Goal:**

My teacher used a program ccalled classcraft, it was a web based application that would split students into teams and these teams would be used to do projects. The program also had random events in which there were events like: Student A gets 100 gold. There was gold, crystals, and health. Bad behaivior or random events would reduce health and if a student died, they would have to complete an assignment to come back to life. Gold was used for cosmetic purposes in the game. Crystals were used to use powers that each student had based on their class: Healer, Guardian, Mage. The best part of this program was that powers affected our assignments, some powers could give you extra points on assignments, others would give a one day extension.

My teacher also added a feature outside of the game using the game's resources. We were able to buy snacks, drinks, school supplies, candy, and even extra points using gold, crystals, and/or hearts. She also had a team bank in which team members would be able to request resources from the bank in exchange for gold. There were also individual vauts which could be used freely to buy things, this was basically na overflow for resources.

This website was shutdown (turned into something completly different) in June 2024. My goal was to bring this back to life. So using Visual Studio and Microsoft SQL Database, I made this project. I kept giving and receiveng updates from my teacher on my progress and any ideas she wanted implemented. In the images folder there are screenshots of my planning, programming and my databse. This project was adventually stopped due to the fact my teacher would not be allowed to use this as I would have access to the backend of the program and thus the emails and login passwords of all the students.
