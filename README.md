An axed project of mine. It does have a cheesy name.

I used Visual Studio 2022 to make this project using ASP.NET Framework in conjunction with Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio.

**Project Goal:**

My teacher used a program called Classcraft, which was a web-based application that split students into teams. These teams were used to do projects. The program also had random events, such as: "Student A gets 100 gold." There was gold, crystals, and health. Bad behavior or random events would reduce health, and if a student "died," they would have to complete an assignment to come back to life. Gold was used for cosmetic purposes in the game. Crystals were used to activate powers that each student had based on their class: Healer, Guardian, Mage. The best part of this program was that the powers affected our assignments. Some powers could give you extra points on assignments, while others would grant a one-day extension.

My teacher also added a feature outside of the game using the game's resources. We were able to buy snacks, drinks, school supplies, candy, and even extra points using gold, crystals, and/or hearts. She also had a team bank in which team members could request resources from the bank in exchange for gold. There were also individual vaults, which could be used freely to buy thingsâ€”this was basically an overflow for resources.

This website was shut down (turned into something completely different) in June 2024. My goal was to bring this back to life. So, using Visual Studio and a Microsoft SQL Database, I made this project. I kept giving and receiving updates from my teacher on my progress and any ideas she wanted implemented. In the images folder, there are screenshots of my planning, programming, and my database. This project was eventually stopped due to the fact that my teacher would not be allowed to use it, as I would have access to the backend of the program and thus the emails and login passwords of all the students.

The organization of this repo quickly dissolved. In an attempt to get GitHub Pages to work, I moved the files for webpage to gh-pages.
